# DS4A-Retail-Challenge

Throughout my fellowship, I was required to created a Dashboard containing trends on user segments, and provide marketing strategies to retain and increase user conversion. I first conducted an EDA in Python, joined datasets in Dataiku, conducted data prepping on Excel, and created a Microstrategy Dashboard. 

This repository contains:
- The EDA done in Jupyter Notebooks
- The Microstrategy Dashboard Views
- SQL Queries
